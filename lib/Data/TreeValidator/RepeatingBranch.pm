=head1 DESCRIPTION

A repeatable branch is one that has a specification, and can consume input
multiple times. The branch can have any valid specification (including
repeatable elements).

This class has all the functionality of L<Data::TreeValidation::Branch>.

=method process($input)

Takes an array reference as input, and attempts to validate each element against
the branch specification.

Returns a L<Data::TreeValidator::Result::Repeating> result object, which can be
inspected to determine if the processing was valid, and to obtain the cleaned
data (which will be wrapped as an array reference).
